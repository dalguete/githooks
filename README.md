# githooks
Utility used to enable some particular capabilities when using git hooks, as
chaining support and load of versioned hook files inside the repo. Your defined
hooks will be preserved, but will live in a more adequate place.


# GENERATED STRUCTURE
-------------------
By default git only handles one hook file per repo. With this solution, you'll
be able to add any amount of hook files, that will be called sequentially.

And this is the new structure:

<pre><strong>
.git/hooks/
 │
 ├── hook files
 ├── hook names folder.d/
 │    ├── script
 │    └── ...
 ├── trackedhooks/
 │    └── hook names folder.d/
 │        ├── script
 │        └── ...
 └── _.sh
</strong></pre>

Can look a bit intimidating, but actually it's really simple.

* **hook files**: are all the Active hook files (use the name of the hook as filename)
  This is the normal git way of handling hook files, but here, in order to support
  chaining, they are only symlinks (ln -s) that points to "_.sh" (more on this, later).

* **hook names folder.d/**: folders that contains all files to be called when a
  hook is executed. For instance, if hook "commit-msg" is Active, a folder named
  "commit-msg.d" must exist.
  Files inside it will be called sequentially, using alphanumeric sort, so you
  state their execution order.

* **trackedhooks/**: link that points to .githooks/ folder, to make them available
  here. Inner structure must follow the one for "*hook names folder*.d/". Only 
  changes performed here are committable.

* **_.sh**: special file used to concentrate all git hooks activity. Remember
  all files in *hook files* are links to this one? Well, that's because this
  is used to dispatch the execution to the other ones, under *hook names folder*.d/
  and/or trackedhooks/, using the hook name as key. That's the reason folders
  must use the hook name as part of their names.
  This file is created by using this script.

This script can be used to create and handle this structure, so you only worry
about creating the hook process you want.

# HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
----------------------

You can perform several operations, as detailed below:

* **`--status/-s [<hook-name> <file-name>] [-t]` (default)**. General status info with all
active hooks and paths to their files. If no options defined, it will print
all hooks info, otherwise only those ones that make a match. '-t' means look
only in trackedhooks/ folder. The status report also includes info about
current structure.

* **`--init`**. Creates the basic structure, as defined above. The next is performed:

  * Remove+Add the _.sh script.
  * Remove+Add the linked trackedhooks/ folder.
  * Transform all active hook files into the new chaining version.

* **`--destroy`**. Reverts the creation of the new structure, New files and folders will
be removed. Active hooks will be kept as active, but in case more than one file
has been detected, only the '00default' will be used. Other files will be left
their respective folders, ones won't be removed to preserve your data.
trackedhooks/ folder and _.sh script will be removed.

* **`--add/-a <hook-name> <file-name> [-t] [--do-edit]`**. Creates a new hook file, given
the hook type and the file name. On collision, it will ask before proceed. The
option '-t' means create it in the trackedhooks/ folder, whenever possible.
When no options given, the command will respond with an error and possible
options.
On success, the route to the new file will be printed and your favorite editor
opened, if the option '--do-edit' is set too

* **`--edit/-e <hook-name> <file-name> [-t]`**. Let you edit a given hook file, given the
hook type and the file name. It uses the favorite editor set. The option '-t'
means search in the trackedhooks/ folder, whenever possible. When no options
given, the command will respond with an error and possible options.

* **`--delete/-d <hook-name> <file-name> [-t]`**. Delete a given hook file, given the
hook type and the file name. The option '-t' means search in the trackedhooks/
folder, whenever possible. When no options given, the command will respond with
an error and possible options.
